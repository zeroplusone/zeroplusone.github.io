As one of the Qualcomm IIE WeTech scholar, I got not only finalcial support but also an amazing six-month virtual mentorship.
These resources helps me a lot with my career in computer science.

At the begining of the program, every scholar is invited to attend the orientation held in Qualcomm Taiwan.
That't the first time I met my mentor, Amanda.
We had a lunch before the orientation and talked a lot about my path in CS.
After knowing my confusions, she shared serveral useful information and her experience as a manager in Qualcomm.
These answers and suggestions from the viewpoint of industry are different from what I got before and motivate me to figure out my career plan.
During the orientaion, I learned the history of Qualcomm, visit the Qualcomm office and met other scholars from EE in my university.
This is just the start of this awesome journey.

During the six-months virtual mentorship, I discussed lots of career-related topics with my mentor including **assessing strengths, career planning, building CV, strenghthening interview skills, networking, enhancing technical and leadership skills**.
In every milestone, lots of resouces, such as websites, speeches and instructions, are provided to help me to accomplish the worksheets.
The next step, I asked some questions and seeked for some suggestions from my mentor.
With a mentor, I had a clearer direction of my career plan and a higher efficiency in improving the quality of my CV and soft skills.
**These topics are so important for students to reduce the gap between academics and industries ,and I feel that I get more prepared to step in industries now.**

To sum up, I really appreciate this opportunities to help me figure out who I am, where my goal is and what I need to do.
Although I haven't had lots of opportunities to practice what I learned from this program in these six months, **these knowledge are so useful and will definitely help my career in the future.**
In the end, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Amanda, Linda and Allie and whole the WeTech Team.
